Dear Mentees,

We are thrilled with the contribution statistics of this year. Make sure you keep the momentum going.

As you may be aware, the mid-evals are on 20th December. It is not a very big obstacle to clear, and neither are the bars too high for passing it.

However, a lot of students are yet to make their first contributions. We request you to race against the clock and finish the same within the next 4 days. This is not an indomitable challenge. Please seek guidance from your mentors, they will be willing to help you.

Regards,
Kharagpur Open Source Society

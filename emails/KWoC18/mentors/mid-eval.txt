Dear Mentor {Name_of_mentor},
Greetings from KOSS,

KWoC Mid-Term evaluations are now open for mentors. 
In the students' mid-term feedback, we asked them to enlist one mentor they are working with, and few of them have nominated you as their mentor.
We request you to be honest with the students, if you spot unsincere efforts and feel they are wasting your time, you should give them a Fail grade.
While at the same time, if they have informed you of being busy with their exams, there is no harm in being generous towards them.
Note that the ones which are given as fail grade, will be removed from the KWoC programme.

Here is your unique link for the evaluation :

Please fill it positively by December 27, 23:59 IST.
We also look forward to hearing from you in the feedback. 

We thank you for bearing with the doubts from your mentees and hope that your projects are growing.
KWoC is not possible without dedicated efforts from mentors like you.

Regards,
Kharagpur Open Source Society

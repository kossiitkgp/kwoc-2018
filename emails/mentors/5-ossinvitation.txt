Body:

Dear KWoC Mentor,

Greetings!

We feel excited to announce that we shall be organizing an Open Source Summit on 21st January 2018 at IIT Kharagpur, during Kshitij 2018. The speakers at the summit include selected 15 KWoC mentors and 1 guest speaker, followed by multiple on-spot lightning talks. The audience of the summit is supposed to be quite diverse, including students who are very new to Open Source as well as some who have been contributing for a significant amount of time. To appreciate your enthusiasm, we invite you to speak at the summit.

Please reply to this email with a very brief abstract of your talk by 31st December 2017 23:59 IST to confirm that you are interested to speak at the summit. The length of the talk can be 15 minutes or 25 minutes.

We also request you to send your T-shirt size along with the reply.

All the selected speakers will get free accommodation during the annual technical fest of IIT Kharagpur, Kshitij. They will also be able to attend all the mega shows and other events of the fest. Check out the website of Kshitij.
If you require financial assistance for travel to Kharagpur, please let us know in the reply. Due to very limited funds, sleeper class train tickets will be reimbursed on the procurement of the ticket or submitting valid PNR number upon arrival.

We urge you to speak because every one of us has an interesting story to tell and putting it into words may, not only help others but even us! If you feel a tiny will inside you to speak and if it is your first time in front of an audience, here is a resource to start with: http://speaking.io

We will be more than happy to clarify if you have any queries. Please help us by replying before the deadline.

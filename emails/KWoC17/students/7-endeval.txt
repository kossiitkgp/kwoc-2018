This is a required part of your KWoC participation. The evaluation requires you to submit a final report for your work. It has to be a URL of either a blog post or a document. You can choose any blogging platform you want. Few examples are Medium.com, WordPress, GitHub static pages and Blogspot. We highly recommend you to submit a blog post, but a link to PDF file is also acceptable. Read the instructions carefully on the form.

We shall notify you about the results soon after the deadline. The stats board will be updated and freezed with the students who successfully complete the program. The decision of the organizing team will be final and shall be based on your report.

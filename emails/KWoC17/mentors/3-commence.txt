Dear mentors,

As mentioned in the timeline, KWoC's coding period officially begins today. We hope that you have set up your projects well with detailed Readme and opened up issues.

Now that students have joined your communication channel and will start/have started working on your projects, there are a few things we would like to iterate:

1. The students may be at a very beginner stage or maybe at their intermediate level. For the first kind, it would be helpful if you bear with their doubts and try getting them a smooth start.

2. We will have the mid evaluation on 15th December. The evaluation guidelines will be shared with you soon.

We leave the rest to your discretion. We hope the students learn a lot under your mentorship. Thanks.

Regards,​​
Kharagpur Open Source Society,
Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.

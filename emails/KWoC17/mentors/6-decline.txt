Hello!

Thank you so much for submitting your Talk in the summit. We have selected 14 Talks out of the responses from 70 KWoC mentors and unfortunately, your talk could not make it on the list.

The event schedule will be released in a few days. There are going to be open slots for Lightning Talks of 5 minutes each. If you will be around the venue at the time, you are requested to give a Lightning Talk. The registration will on-spot.

Regards,
